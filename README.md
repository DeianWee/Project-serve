# SSTatistics hitmapper
### by bridgit

## Our problem: 

Hitmaps, the system used in S&W lessons to mark positions a player shoots or passes, is very hard to use and sometimes difficult to understand. We aim to make the recording process easier while making the map simpler to understand and comprehend so that students can better reflect and improve.


## Our problem statement:

How can we make the hitmapping process more convenient and easier for students?


## Our research:

Our users want a convenient and easy way to make hitmaps during their S&W lessons. They currently use pen and paper, which is very messy and inconvenient as they usually need a clipboard, and even so, it is hard to use a clipboard while standing. They lose their hitmaps if the teacher asks them to keep it, and sometimes they forget to hand it in to the teacher. 

They want an easy way to make and delete markers on a map. They want to be able to save their hitmaps for easy access in the next lesson or to be able to submit them easily. 
[This](https://csdt.org/static/CSDT_Single_Page/Basketball_Heatmap/src/index.html) is one competitor we have. Our hitmap maker will allow players to mark any place on the map and is more intuitive to use. 
Another competitor is SIQ’s heatmap maker. Our hitmap maker is more manual but does not need an external device. 


## Our solution:

The app allows students to mark where a ball is thrown from and whether it is scored or missed. It can also show passes between teammates and where a player dribbled the ball. allow the user to temporarily hide some of the markings after a certain period and press a button to show all the markings. The app will show the current game score above the drawing area. When the game is over, the player can press the ‘review game’ function to see all the lines drawn. There will also be a drawing with all the lines in one picture on top of all the individual markings. The app may also feature a final review, which tells them something like “You dribbled a lot!” or “You lost the ball at this point a lot.”

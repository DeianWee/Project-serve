## Our problem: 

hitmaps, the system used in SnW lessons to mark positions that a player shoots or passes, is very hard to use and sometimes is difficult to understand. We aim to make the recording process easier while also making the map less difficult to understand and comprehend so that students can reflect and improve.


## Our problem statement:

How can we make the hit mapping process more convenient and easier for students?


## Our research:

Heat maps have a lot of benefits, like telling a player whether he should dribble the ball into open space more often, for example. However, soccer and basketball are many sports that use hit maps, where players often run around. This can lead to many lines all over the map and make the heatmap messy and unorganized. 



## Our solution:

The app allows students to mark where a ball is thrown from and whether it is scored or missed. It can also show passes between teammates and where a player dribbled the ball. allow the user to hide some of the markings after a certain period and press a button to temporarily show all the markings. The app will show the current game score above the drawing area. When the game is over, the player can press the ‘review game’ function to see all the lines drawn. There will also be a drawing with all the lines in one picture on top of all the individual markings. The app may also feature a final review, which tells them something like “You dribbled a lot!” or “You lost the ball at this point a lot.”

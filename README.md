# SSTatistics hitmapper
### by bridgit

## Our problem: 

Hitmaps, the system used in S&W lessons to mark positions a player shoots or passes, is very hard to use and sometimes difficult to understand. We aim to make the recording process easier while making the map simpler to understand and comprehend so that students can better reflect and improve.


## Our problem statement:

How can we make the hitmapping process more convenient and easier for students?


## Our research:

Hitmaps have a lot of benefits, like telling a player whether he should dribble the ball into open space more often. However, as this is usually done with pen and paper, it is often messy. Additionally, as the students usually do not have a clipboard, it is difficult to draw properly on the cross, leading to hard-to-read markings. Students also have difficulties keeping this paper with them, often losing it. 


## Our solution:

The app allows students to mark where a ball is thrown from and whether it is scored or missed. It can also show passes between teammates and where a player dribbled the ball. allow the user to temporarily hide some of the markings after a certain period and press a button to show all the markings. The app will show the current game score above the drawing area. When the game is over, the player can press the ‘review game’ function to see all the lines drawn. There will also be a drawing with all the lines in one picture on top of all the individual markings. The app may also feature a final review, which tells them something like “You dribbled a lot!” or “You lost the ball at this point a lot.”
